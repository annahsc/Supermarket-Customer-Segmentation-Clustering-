## 🛒 Customer Segmentation Analysis

This project focuses on segmenting supermarket customers using clustering techniques to support targeted marketing strategies. The dataset consists of 4,000 customer records collected via loyalty cards and includes features such as age, gender, and annual income.

The notebook begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer distribution and highlight key trends using visual tools like histograms and pie charts. It then applies **K-Means++** and **Agglomerative Clustering** to group customers into distinct segments.

To determine the optimal number of clusters, both the **Elbow Method** and **Silhouette Analysis** are used. Clusters are profiled based on demographic and financial attributes, with comparisons drawn between the two clustering approaches.

The final section interprets each customer group and offers **marketing recommendations** tailored to their characteristics. This analysis supports data-driven decisions for improving customer engagement, product targeting, and personalized promotions.
